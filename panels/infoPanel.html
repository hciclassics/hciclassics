    Hey all!
    <br /><br />
    In previous years, Humberside has been rather disorganized in our
    approach to classics. This site is part of the attempt to fix that.
    Hopefully being able to keep all of our resources and upcoming news
    in one place, we can all be more aware of exactly what is going on.

    It is true; other school's sites are much flashier. My goal for us is not to
    surpass them in that regard, but to make a 100% stable site without any bugs
    that is clean and purposeful, doing no more and no less than it needs to.
